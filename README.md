# Infinite scroll with Go and HTMX

This project focuses on using htmx triggers and function maps to implement an endless scroll. There are definitely things that looks overcomplicated, but for now it works. 

## Quickstart

This project assumes you have Golang installed. Run the following script on your terminal to start the application

```sh
make run
```

And then go to `localhost:5000` on your browser
